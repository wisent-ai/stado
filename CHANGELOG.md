# Changelog

Entries for the release being prepared live here. Released entries move into
`changelog/`, one file per version range, so the active file remains within
the repository's file-size limit.

The version-bump commit moves them with `stado product changelog --version V`;
`stado build submit` refuses a revision whose Unreleased section still holds entries.

## Unreleased

- A release pass no longer records its failure over a run another pass has advanced since it read it. The control host's release agent and `stado release resume` both walk a run; the pass that lost the write race (`Stado storage version changed for runs/release-pipeline/<run>/run.json`) marked the run `failed`, and every delivery worker then refused its job with "the run is Failed, not delivering".
